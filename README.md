Professional Portfolio for Carlie Smith

Thank you for visiting my page.

I'm currently in the Sales channel with 22 years of operations experience prior to that.
Coding is a new skill and channel for me, I am attending the MSU Boot Camp.

5 of my projects are featured on this page and you may access my work on the
Run Buddy website to see my coding live.

Building this site was a challenge for me and helped build my CSS skills.  I am still
learning about flexboxes and much of the screen sizing for responsive layouts.  Placement of items on the screen is another area that I need to practice more so that I can understand how to manage the layout.

The work we did on Run Buddy in the modules was invaluable in completing this challenge, I was able to use a lot of that work, rethink it and build some understanding of what we did and why to make the Portfolio.
